#### Running the server for Dev

- Also note you can use spring-dev-tools to build front and back-end component in dev mode providing faster restarts and live-reload.

for dev mode run the following with the appropriate profiles
```
mvn spring-boot:run mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active=servicerequest,integration,cors
```

WARNING: spring-dev-tools affects the way Camunda serializes objects into process vars and will cause serialization errors in some cases. So it is commented out in pom.xml by default.


### Externalizing Configuration

All the properties in the .properties files can be externalized.

Look at the **_application-prod.properties_** files for examples of utilizing environment variables with the app. This is particularly useful if your running in serverless environment and you cannot store property values in your code repo.


## Deploying the app

### Docker and Docker-Compose

Services are configure in the docker-compose.yaml to run the app in docker with a default network.

1. Uncomment the appropriate services for your application and profiles in the docker-compose.yaml located in the docker-compose directory.
2. Make sure to build the spring-boot app
3. run docker-compose up from the docker-compose directory


#### Environment configs

There are a few configurations you must add to Heroku for the app to work correctly

- JDBC_DATABASE_URL - This config is added for you. You wont see it in the Heroku dashboard. Run the following command to confirm this is set.
